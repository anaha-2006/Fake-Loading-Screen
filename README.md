# Fake-Loading-Screen
 This is a tiny, fun Chrome extension that briefly displays a realistic loading overlay on any webpage. When activated, it shows a semi-transparent screen with a spinner and progress bar with “Loading…” message. It doesn’t refresh or change the page just simulates a quick loading moment for fun or testing UI behavior.
